### 1.2.1 - (2021-04-15)

- `createSession`, `createReceiver`, and `createSender` methods now only close underlying rhea analogue when cancelled if the resource has already been opened.

### 1.2.0 - 2021-03-25
- Exposes the `incoming` getter on the `Session` that lets accessing size and capacity of the incoming deliveries [#79](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/79).
- Updates the error message for the `AbortError` to be a standard message `The operation was aborted.`.

### 1.1.0 - 2021-02-08
- All async methods now take a signal that can be used to cancel the operation. Fixes [#48](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/issues/48)
- Added a `timeoutInSeconds` parameter to the `send` method on the `AwaitableSender` that overrides the timeout value for the send operation set when creating the sender.
- When the `error` event is fired when closing the sender/receiver link, surface errors occurring on the sender/receiver context if none are found on the session context. Details can be found in [PR #55](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/55)
- Updated minimum version of `rhea` to `^1.0.24`. Details can be found in [PR 68](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/68)

### 1.0.0 - 2019-06-27
- Updated minimum version of `rhea` to `^1.0.8`.
- Added a read only property `id` to the `Session` object. The id property is created by concatenating session's local channel, remote channel and the connection id `"local-<number>_remote-<number>_<connection-id>"`, thus making it unique for that connection.
- Improved log statements by adding the session `id` and the sender, receiver `name` to help while debugging applications.
- Added `options` to `Link.close({closeSession: true | false})`, thus the user can specify whether the underlying session should be closed while closing the `Sender|Receiver`. Default is `true`.
- Improved `open` and `close` operations on `Connection`, `Session` and `Link` by creating timer in case the connection gets disconnected. Fixes [#41](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/issues/41).
- The current `Sender` does not have a provision of **"awaiting"** on sending a message. The user needs to add handlers on the `Sender` for `accepted`, `rejected`, `released`, `modified` to ensure whether the message was successfully sent.
Now, we have added a new `AwaitableSender` which adds the handlers internally and provides an **awaitable** `send()` operation to the customer. Fixes [#45](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/issues/45).
- Exporting new Errors:
   - `InsufficientCreditError`: Defines the error that occurs when the Sender does not have enough credit.
   - `SendOperationFailedError`: Defines the error that occurs when the Sender fails to send a message.

### 0.2.0 - 2019-05-17
- Updated `OperationTimeoutError` to be a non-AMQP Error as pointed out in [#42](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/issues/42). Fixed in [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/43).

### 0.1.15 - 2019-04-10
- Export rhea types for `Typed`. [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/36).
- Export rhea types for `WebSocketImpl` and `WebSocketInstance`.  [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/38).
- When opening a connection fails with no error, use standard error message. [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/27).

### 0.1.14 - 2019-03-19
- Allow websockets usage on a connection without creating a container first. [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/32).
- New function `removeAllSessions()` on the connection to clear the internal map in rhea to ensure 
sessions are not reconnected on the next `connection.open()` call. [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/33).
- Remove all event listeners on link and session objects when `close()` is called on them. [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/34)

### 0.1.13 - 2018-12-11
- Throw `OperationTimeoutError` when a Promise to create/close an entity is rejected.

### 0.1.12 - 2018-11-16
- Fix a minor bug in receiver creation.

### 0.1.11 - 2018-11-15
- Added checks for some event handler methods to exist before logging information that uses node's
event handlers inbuilt functions.
- Improved error checking while creating the receiver.

### 0.1.10 - 2018-11-01
- Provided an option to add an event handler for "settled" event on the Receiver.

### 0.1.9 - 2018-10-24
- With the usage of `importHelpers`, the tslib will be needed in package.json for installers using older versions of npm (or using yarn). [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/16).

### 0.1.8 - 2018-10-22
- Allow setting drain property on the receiver [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/14).

### 0.1.7 - 2018-10-19
- Fixed a bug while populating the connectionId [PR](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise/pull/11).

### 0.1.6 - 2018-09-28
- property `actionInitiated` is now of type `number` which is incremented when the `create`, `close`
action on an entity is under process and decremented when the action completes (succeeeded or failed).

### 0.1.5 - 2018-09-27
- Improved log statements for better debugging.
- Any type of `error` event will be emitted with a tick delay. This would give enough time for the
`create()` methods to resolve the promise.
- Added a new `boolean` property `actionInitiated` which indicates whether the `create`, `close`
action on an entity is under process.

### 0.1.4 - 2018-09-25
- `options` is a required property of `Connection` and `Container`.

### 0.1.3 - 2018-09-25
- Transform relevant objects in rhea EventContext to rhea-promise objects.
- Ensure that `container.createConnection()` creates a connection on that container and not on
the default container.

### 0.1.2 - 2018-09-20
- TS target to ES2015. This should help us support node.js version 6.x and above.

### 0.1.1 - 2018-09-20
- Update homepage, repository and bug urls in package.json

### 0.1.0 - 2018-09-20
- Initial version of rhea-promise.
